Background: Complete in 3.1s
Memory Save: ✅ SUCCESS - Saved to database AND indexed in RAG
Notes: FIRST SUCCESSFUL MEMORY TOOL CALL!

ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================

Pre-Deployment (Old Prompt):
- Turns with shareable info: 3 (football, playing with friends, biryani)
- Memory tool calls: 0 ❌
- Profile updates: 3
- Tool call rate: 0%

Post-Deployment (New Prompt):
- Turns with shareable info: 1 (biryani preference)
- Memory tool calls: 1 ✅
- Profile updates: 1
- Tool call rate: 100%

KEY FINDINGS
============

1. OLD PROMPT ISSUES:
   ❌ Memory tools never called despite clear opportunities
   ❌ Relied solely on background profile updates
   ❌ Important user info not stored in structured memory
   ❌ Instructions buried in 7,600 char prompt

2. NEW PROMPT SUCCESS:
   ✅ Memory tool called immediately when user shared preference
   ✅ Proper categorization (PREFERENCE for food)
   ✅ Saved to both Supabase AND RAG
   ✅ Clear, prominent instructions (3,500 chars)

3. PERFORMANCE METRICS:
   - Profile fetch optimization working (only fetches when message >20 chars)
   - Background processing non-blocking
   - Response times: 1-3 seconds (acceptable)
   - State broadcasting working (thinking/speaking states)

4. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
   - VAD sensitivity still needs tuning (users speaking loud)
   - Greeting timing needs refinement
   - Redis connection failing (localhost vs Railway Redis)

CONCLUSION
==========
The NEW PROMPT shows immediate improvement in memory tool usage.
The prominent "CRITICAL" section and code examples successfully
guided the LLM to call storeInMemory when appropriate.

Recommendation: Keep new prompt, monitor for 100+ more sessions
to confirm sustained improvement in tool calling behavior.
