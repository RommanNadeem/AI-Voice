# Troubleshooting: Agent Worker "Listening" but No Job Received

## Current Situation

**Logs show:**
```
INFO:livekit.agents:registered worker {"id": "AW_LEZ4A8P3cZAX", "url": "wss://mahira-5efzx2ms.livekit.cloud"}
```

But **NO** entrypoint logs like:
```
[ENTRYPOINT] üöÄ NEW JOB RECEIVED
[ENTRYPOINT] Room: ...
```

## What This Means

‚úÖ **Agent worker is running correctly**
‚úÖ **Connected to LiveKit Cloud** (Singapore region)
‚úÖ **Registered and waiting for jobs**
‚ùå **No room connection/job has been dispatched yet**

The worker is in "standby" mode waiting for someone to:
1. Create a room
2. Connect to that room
3. Trigger the agent to join

---

## Root Cause: No Frontend Connection

This is **NOT** a bug in the agent code. This means:
- Your **frontend hasn't connected** to a LiveKit room yet, OR
- The **agent dispatch rules** aren't configured to send the agent to the room

---

## How LiveKit Agent Dispatch Works

```
1. Frontend creates/joins room
   ‚Üì
2. LiveKit server sees room has participants
   ‚Üì
3. LiveKit checks if agent should be dispatched
   ‚Üì
4. If YES ‚Üí LiveKit calls your entrypoint function
   ‚Üì
5. Agent joins room and starts conversation
```

Currently, you're stuck at step 1 or 3.

---

## Solution 1: Check Frontend Connection

### Verify Your Frontend Code:

```typescript
// React/Next.js example
import { Room } from 'livekit-client';

const connectToAgent = async (userId: string) => {
  // 1. Get token from your backend
  const response = await fetch('/api/livekit-token', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
      userId,
      roomName: `user-${userId}-room`  // Unique room per user
    })
  });
  
  const { token, url } = await response.json();
  
  // 2. Connect to room
  const room = new Room();
  
  await room.connect(url, token, {
    autoSubscribe: true,
  });
  
  // 3. Enable microphone (REQUIRED for agent to hear you)
  await room.localParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled(true);
  
  console.log('‚úÖ Connected to room:', room.name);
};
```

### Required: Enable Microphone
```typescript
// The agent needs audio input to start
await room.localParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled(true);
```

---

## Solution 2: Check Agent Dispatch Configuration

### Option A: Auto-dispatch on Room Creation

In your LiveKit Cloud dashboard or config:

```yaml
# livekit.yaml or dashboard settings
room:
  auto_create: true
  
agents:
  # Dispatch agent when ANY participant joins
  dispatch:
    - name: companion-agent
      on_participant_connected: true
      room_name: "*"  # Or specific pattern like "user-*"
```

### Option B: Manual Agent Dispatch from Backend

If you're manually dispatching agents:

```python
# Your backend API endpoint
from livekit import api

async def dispatch_agent(room_name: str):
    lk_api = api.LiveKitAPI(
        url='https://mahira-5efzx2ms.livekit.cloud',
        api_key=LIVEKIT_API_KEY,
        api_secret=LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
    )
    
    # Create agent dispatch request
    await lk_api.agent.create_dispatch(
        room=room_name,
        agent_name="companion-agent"  # Your agent name
    )
```

---

## Solution 3: Test with CLI

### Quick Test - Does Agent Respond to Room Creation?

```bash
# Terminal 1: Your agent is already running ‚úÖ

# Terminal 2: Create a test room and join it
# Install LiveKit CLI if not already:
# npm install -g livekit-cli

# Generate a test token
livekit-cli token create \
  --api-key <your-api-key> \
  --api-secret <your-api-secret> \
  --join --room test-room-123 \
  --identity test-user \
  --valid-for 1h

# This will output a token - use it to test
```

Or use the LiveKit Playground:
1. Go to: https://meet.livekit.io/custom
2. Enter your LiveKit Cloud URL
3. Use a test token
4. Join the room
5. Check if agent logs show `[ENTRYPOINT] üöÄ NEW JOB RECEIVED`

---

## Solution 4: Check LiveKit Token Generation

Your backend needs to generate tokens that:

```python
from livekit import api
import os

def create_livekit_token(user_id: str):
    # IMPORTANT: Each user gets their own room
    room_name = f"user-{user_id}-room"
    
    token = api.AccessToken(
        api_key=os.getenv("LIVEKIT_API_KEY"),
        api_secret=os.getenv("LIVEKIT_API_SECRET")
    )
    
    token.with_identity(user_id)  # User's identity
    token.with_name(user_id)      # Display name
    
    # Grant permissions
    token.with_grants(api.VideoGrants(
        room_join=True,
        room=room_name,
        can_publish=True,      # User can publish audio
        can_subscribe=True,    # User can hear agent
    ))
    
    # Token valid for 1 hour
    token.with_ttl(timedelta(hours=1))
    
    return {
        'token': token.to_jwt(),
        'url': os.getenv("LIVEKIT_URL"),
        'room_name': room_name
    }
```

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check LiveKit Dashboard

Go to: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects

**Look for:**
- ‚úÖ Active rooms (should show your room when user connects)
- ‚úÖ Participants in the room
- ‚úÖ Agent dispatch events
- ‚ùå Any errors in the logs

### 2. Enable Verbose Logging

Add to your agent startup:

```bash
# Set log level to DEBUG
export LIVEKIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run agent with verbose output
python agent.py
```

### 3. Check Agent Logs

Look for these specific messages:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - Agent received job
[ENTRYPOINT] üöÄ NEW JOB RECEIVED
[ENTRYPOINT] Room: user-123-room

# ‚ùå Bad - No entrypoint logs at all
# This means no room connection happened
```

### 4. Test Frontend Connection

Add logging to your frontend:

```typescript
room.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Room connected:', room.name);
  console.log('‚úÖ Participants:', room.participants.size);
});

room.on('participantConnected', (participant) => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Participant joined:', participant.identity);
  
  // Check if it's the agent
  if (participant.identity.includes('agent')) {
    console.log('ü§ñ Agent has joined the room!');
  }
});

room.on('trackSubscribed', (track) => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Track subscribed:', track.kind);
});
```

---

## Expected Flow (When Working)

### Frontend:
```
1. User clicks "Start Conversation"
2. Frontend requests token from backend
3. Frontend connects to LiveKit room
4. Frontend enables microphone
5. Frontend waits for agent to join
```

### Backend Logs (Your Agent):
```
[ENTRYPOINT] üöÄ NEW JOB RECEIVED
[ENTRYPOINT] Room: user-abc123-room
[ENTRYPOINT] Waiting for participant to join...
[ENTRYPOINT] Participant joined: sid=PA_xxx, identity=abc123
[SESSION INIT] Starting LiveKit session with participant...
[SESSION INIT] ‚úì Session started and ready to listen
[AUDIO] Waiting for participant audio track to be ready...
[AUDIO] ‚úì Audio track subscribed: TR_xxx
[AUDIO] ‚úì Audio track fully ready
[GREETING] Generating first message with context...
[GREETING] ‚úì First message sent!
```

### Frontend (User Experience):
```
1. "Connecting..." 
2. "Connected!" (room joined)
3. Agent starts speaking (greeting)
4. User can now talk to agent
```

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Frontend connects to LiveKit room
- [ ] Frontend enables microphone (`setMicrophoneEnabled(true)`)
- [ ] Room name follows pattern (e.g., `user-{userId}-room`)
- [ ] Token is valid and has correct permissions
- [ ] Agent dispatch is configured in LiveKit
- [ ] Agent worker is running (you see "registered worker" ‚úÖ)
- [ ] Check LiveKit dashboard for active rooms

---

## Still Not Working?

### Share These Logs:

1. **Frontend console logs** (browser DevTools)
2. **Backend token generation logs**
3. **Agent worker logs** (what you already shared)
4. **LiveKit dashboard** - screenshot of rooms/participants

### Environment Variables to Check:

```bash
# Agent needs these:
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://mahira-5efzx2ms.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=<your-key>
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=<your-secret>

# Frontend needs:
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://mahira-5efzx2ms.livekit.cloud

# Backend needs (for token generation):
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=<your-key>
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=<your-secret>
```

## Summary

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Agent worker is running and healthy
- ‚úÖ Connected to LiveKit Cloud
- ‚ùå No room connection/job received

**Next Steps:**
1. **Verify frontend is connecting** to a LiveKit room
2. **Enable microphone** in frontend
3. **Check agent dispatch configuration**
4. **Test with LiveKit Playground** to isolate issue

The agent code is working correctly. The issue is in the connection/dispatch flow, not the agent itself.
