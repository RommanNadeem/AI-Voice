# Agent Stuck at "Listening" - Debug Guide

## üî¥ The Problem

Your agent starts successfully but then immediately stops:

```
INFO:livekit.agents:registered worker
2025-10-07 22:30:12,389 - INFO livekit.agents - registered worker
Stopping Container
```

The key issue is this warning:
```
WARNING:watchfiles.main:received signal 15, raising KeyboardInterrupt
```

**Signal 15 (SIGTERM)** means the container is being killed by the deployment platform, not by your code.

---

## üîç Root Causes

### 1. Health Check Failure
Railway (or your platform) may have health checks that expect HTTP responses, but LiveKit agents don't expose HTTP endpoints by default.

### 2. Idle Timeout
Some platforms kill containers that don't receive traffic within a certain time.

### 3. No Job Assignment
The agent registers but if no LiveKit room/job is assigned quickly, the platform might think it's idle.

### 4. Missing Keep-Alive
The platform expects some signal that the app is alive and working.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Health Check Endpoint (Recommended)

Add a simple HTTP health endpoint so Railway knows the agent is alive:

```python
# Add at the top of agent.py
from aiohttp import web
import asyncio

# Add before entrypoint function
async def health_check_server():
    """Simple HTTP server for health checks"""
    async def health(request):
        return web.Response(text="OK", status=200)
    
    app = web.Application()
    app.router.add_get('/health', health)
    app.router.add_get('/', health)
    
    runner = web.AppRunner(app)
    await runner.setup()
    site = web.TCPSite(runner, '0.0.0.0', 8080)
    await site.start()
    print("[HEALTH] HTTP health check server running on port 8080")

# Modify the main block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start health check server in background
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    loop.create_task(health_check_server())
    
    # Run the agent
    agents.cli.run_app(agents.WorkerOptions(
        entrypoint_fnc=entrypoint,
        initialize_process_timeout=60,
    ))
```

Then in Railway, set:
- **Health Check Path**: `/health`
- **Health Check Port**: `8080`

### Solution 2: Increase Timeouts

In your Railway settings:
- Set health check timeout to 60 seconds
- Set health check interval to 30 seconds
- Set restart policy to "on-failure" not "always"

### Solution 3: Add Better Logging

Add this to see exactly when/why the agent exits:

```python
import signal

def handle_sigterm(signum, frame):
    print(f"[SIGNAL] Received signal {signum}, initiating graceful shutdown...")
    # Don't exit immediately, let the agent finish current job
    raise KeyboardInterrupt()

# Add in main block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)
    print("[MAIN] SIGTERM handler registered")
    
    agents.cli.run_app(agents.WorkerOptions(
        entrypoint_fnc=entrypoint,
        initialize_process_timeout=60,
    ))
```

### Solution 4: Check Railway Configuration

Make sure your Railway service is configured as:
- **Type**: Worker (not Web Service with auto-sleep)
- **Region**: Same as LiveKit (Singapore in your logs)
- **Restart Policy**: On-failure
- **Auto-sleep**: Disabled

## üîß Quick Fix Implementation

Here's the minimal change to add health checks:

1. Install aiohttp:
```bash
pip install aiohttp
# Add to requirements.txt
```

2. Add this code to agent.py after imports:

```python
from aiohttp import web
import threading

def start_health_server():
    """Background HTTP server for health checks"""
    async def health(request):
        return web.Response(text="OK\n", status=200)
    
    async def run_server():
        app = web.Application()
        app.router.add_get('/health', health)
        app.router.add_get('/', health)
        
        runner = web.AppRunner(app)
        await runner.setup()
        site = web.TCPSite(runner, '0.0.0.0', 8080)
        await site.start()
        print("[HEALTH] ‚úì Health check server running on :8080")
        
        # Keep server running
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    
    # Run in background thread
    def thread_target():
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
        loop.run_until_complete(run_server())
    
    thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_target, daemon=True)
    thread.start()
```

3. Call it in main:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_health_server()  # Add this line
    
    agents.cli.run_app(agents.WorkerOptions(
        entrypoint_fnc=entrypoint,
        initialize_process_timeout=60,
    ))
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Locally
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run agent
python agent.py

# Terminal 2: Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Should return: OK
```

### Test in Railway
1. Deploy with health check code
2. Check logs for: `[HEALTH] ‚úì Health check server running on :8080`
3. In Railway settings, set Health Check Path to `/health`
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for health checks to pass

---

## üîç Additional Debugging

If still having issues, add this at the very start of your entrypoint:

```python
async def entrypoint(ctx: agents.JobContext):
    print("="*80)
    print("[ENTRYPOINT] üöÄ AGENT STARTING")
    print(f"[ENTRYPOINT] Room: {ctx.room.name}")
    print(f"[ENTRYPOINT] Room SID: {ctx.room.sid}")
    print(f"[ENTRYPOINT] Job ID: {ctx.job.id if ctx.job else 'No job'}")
    print("="*80)
    
    # ... rest of entrypoint
```

This will show if the entrypoint is even being called when a room is created.

---

## üìä Expected Behavior After Fix

### Without Health Check (Current - BAD)
```
registered worker
Stopping Container  ‚Üê Platform kills it
```

### With Health Check (After Fix - GOOD)
```
[HEALTH] ‚úì Health check server running on :8080
registered worker
[Health checks passing...]
[Agent stays alive waiting for jobs]
```

---

## üéØ Most Likely Issue

Based on your logs, the most likely issue is:

1. ‚úÖ Agent starts correctly
2. ‚úÖ Registers with LiveKit
3. ‚ùå Railway doesn't see HTTP health checks
4. ‚ùå Railway thinks app is unhealthy/idle
5. ‚ùå Railway sends SIGTERM to kill it

**Solution**: Add the health check HTTP endpoint above.

---

## üìû Alternative: Use LiveKit Cloud Agents

If the health check doesn't solve it, consider using LiveKit Cloud's managed agents instead of self-hosting on Railway. They handle all this automatically.

---

## üö® Emergency Workaround

If you need it working RIGHT NOW without code changes:

1. Railway ‚Üí Settings
2. Change service type from "Web Service" to "Worker"
3. Disable health checks completely
4. Set restart policy to "never"

This will keep the container running but is not a proper long-term solution.
