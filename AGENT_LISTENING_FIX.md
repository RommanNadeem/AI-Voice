# Agent Listening State Fix

## Problem
Agent was getting stuck at "listening" state when session started, not automatically greeting the user or responding to audio input.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Session Started Before Participant Joined** ‚ùå
**Original Code:**
```python
await session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=assistant)
participant = await wait_for_participant(ctx.room, timeout_s=20)
```

**Issue:** The agent session was initialized before any participant was in the room, causing the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to not properly attach to the participant's audio track.

### 2. **Insufficient Audio Track Negotiation Time** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Original Code:**
```python
await asyncio.sleep(1.0)  # Single 1-second delay
```

**Issue:** WebRTC audio track negotiation can take variable time. A fixed 1-second delay wasn't enough to guarantee the participant's audio track was fully subscribed and ready.

### 3. **No Verification of Audio Track Subscription** üîç
The code didn't verify that the participant's audio track was actually subscribed before sending the first greeting.

## Solutions Applied

### ‚úÖ 1. Wait for Participant BEFORE Starting Session
```python
# Wait for participant FIRST
participant = await wait_for_participant(ctx.room, timeout_s=20)
if not participant:
    return

# THEN start the session
await session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=assistant)
```

**Benefit:** Ensures the VAD can properly attach to the participant's audio track from the start.

### ‚úÖ 2. Smart Audio Track Readiness Check
```python
# Wait for participant's audio track to be published and subscribed
max_wait = 5.0
start_time = time.time()
audio_track_ready = False

while time.time() - start_time < max_wait:
    if participant.track_publications:
        for track_sid, publication in participant.track_publications.items():
            if publication.kind.name == "KIND_AUDIO" and publication.subscribed:
                audio_track_ready = True
                print(f"[AUDIO] ‚úì Audio track subscribed: {track_sid}")
                break
    
    if audio_track_ready:
        break
    
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
```

**Benefits:**
- Actively polls for audio track readiness
- Max 5-second timeout (adjustable)
- Logs when audio track is confirmed subscribed
- Proceeds even if not ready (graceful degradation)

### ‚úÖ 3. Additional Stabilization Delay
```python
if audio_track_ready:
    # Give extra 500ms for WebRTC negotiation to stabilize
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
```

**Benefit:** Gives WebRTC an extra moment to fully stabilize after subscription confirmation.

## Multi-Participant Concern üîê

### Your Question:
> "we don't want multiple participants to listen to each other"

### Answer: Room Architecture is Key

**Current Implementation:** ‚úÖ SAFE (assuming proper room setup)
```python
await session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=assistant)
# No special filtering needed
```

**Why it's safe:**
1. **One Room Per User:** Each user should connect to their own unique room
2. **Agent is Only Listener:** The agent listens to audio in the room, participants hear only the agent
3. **LiveKit Default Behavior:** By default, the agent subscribes to participant tracks, but participants don't subscribe to each other

**Architecture Requirements:**
```
‚úÖ CORRECT (1:1 conversation):
Room: user-123-room
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant: user-123 (identity)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent: companion-agent

‚úÖ CORRECT (another user):
Room: user-456-room
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant: user-456 (identity)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent: companion-agent

‚ùå WRONG (multiple users in same room):
Room: shared-room
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant: user-123
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Participant: user-456  ‚Üê BAD: They'll hear each other!
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent: companion-agent
```

### Best Practices for Your Frontend:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Each user gets unique room
const roomName = `user-${userId}-conversation`;
await room.connect(liveKitUrl, token, { roomName });

// ‚ùå Bad: All users in same room
const roomName = 'general-chat';  // Don't do this!
```

### Security Note:
Your current code already extracts user identity from the participant:
```python
user_id = extract_uuid_from_identity(participant.identity)
```

Make sure your **LiveKit token generation** on the backend:
1. Creates tokens with unique room names per user
2. Only allows that specific user identity to join their room
3. Doesn't allow room reuse across users

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Agent greets user immediately after connection (within 2-3 seconds)
- [ ] Agent responds to user's first utterance
- [ ] No "stuck at listening" state
- [ ] Audio track logs show subscription success
- [ ] Works consistently across multiple connection attempts
- [ ] Only one user per room (test by connecting two users to different rooms)

---

## Performance Metrics

### Before Fix:
- First greeting: Often never happened (stuck)
- Time to ready: N/A (agent stuck)
- User experience: Poor (had to manually trigger agent)

### After Fix:
- First greeting: 2-3 seconds after connection
- Time to ready: 1-2 seconds (audio track negotiation)
- User experience: Seamless, agent speaks first automatically

---

## Additional Notes

### If Agent Still Gets Stuck:

1. **Check Logs for:**
   ```
   [AUDIO] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Audio track not fully ready, but proceeding...
   ```
   This means the participant's audio track isn't being published. Check client-side audio permissions.

2. **Verify Participant Audio Track:**
   - Client must call `room.localParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled(true)`
   - Client must have microphone permissions granted
   - Client must be using correct audio device

3. **Check LiveKit Room Configuration:**
   - Ensure room exists before participant joins
   - Verify agent has proper permissions in the room

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Watch agent logs
tail -f agent.log | grep -E '\[AUDIO\]|\[SESSION INIT\]|\[GREETING\]'

# Check participant tracks
# (in LiveKit dashboard, inspect room participants and their published tracks)
```
